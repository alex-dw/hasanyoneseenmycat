    <p>This is Clawdia (no, I didn't spell that incorrectly).</p>
    <p>She unfortunately went missing on <b>Sunday the 20th of July, 2024</b>, in the Thornes Area of Wakefield, West Yorkshire.</p>

    <img style="margin-top:40px;" src="clawdia/map.png" alt="Screenshot of Wakefield from Google Maps, with a radius around Thornes Park, Wakefield.">
    <p>Here's an idea of where she went missing. We'd like to think that she would still be in this radius, albeit a bit lost - but she is known to be quite adventurous.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Here's what you need to know:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clawdia is a tabby cat.</li>
            <li>Clawdia is 10 years old.</li>
            <li>Clawdia is microchipped, and neutered.</li>
            <li>Clawdia is <em>very</em> timid.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Her timidness is no match for her hunger - she will like you if you have food.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>She has white socks (her paws are white).</li>
            <li>She has a broken bottom right canine (from fighting other cats, presumably - she's fine).</li>
        </ul>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top:0px; font-size:14px;">Here's a better picture of her face - note the white under on her nose. Not a lot of tabby cats have this!</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top:0px; font-size:14px;">She's a bit silly, and sleeps with her tongue out.</p>
